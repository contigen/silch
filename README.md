# Silch

**Private-by-default crypto payments using one-time addresses.**

Silch lets people receive crypto payments **without exposing their entire wallet history**.  
Each payment uses a **one-time address**, preventing address reuse and reducing unwanted financial visibility.

## The Problem

Public blockchains make payments transparent by default.

That’s great for settlement — but terrible for everyday use.

Reusing a wallet address means:
- anyone can see past and future payments
- income patterns become public
- private relationships are exposed

This makes crypto awkward for creators, freelancers, and normal peer-to-peer payments.

## The Opportunity

There is growing demand for:
- creator monetisation
- freelance and remote payments
- casual crypto transfers

But **most users do not want financial transparency by default**.

Silch sits between fully public wallets and heavy privacy protocols:
- no mixers
- no new chains
- no complex cryptography for users

Just better defaults.

## Who It’s For

### Creators
Accept tips or one-off payments without publishing your full income history.

### Freelancers
Send private payment links instead of reusable wallet addresses.

### Everyday Users
Make casual transfers without permanently linking wallets.
